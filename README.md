# hello-world

This was my first repository on GitHub, and I was going to simpy use the print funtion to print "Hello World!" using python, but that seems a bit too easy and straight forward.  So, I took a different approach.

`print("Hello World!")`

### Different Introductory Approach

The Python file in this repository explores the impoementation of what are called functions, written in the form:

```
def function(argument):
    return "the processed argument as output"
```
Functions take in an argument, process it as necessary for its use, then provides an output via the return statment.  The output can take the shape of a variable, which can point to an object.
