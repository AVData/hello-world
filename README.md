# hello-world

This is my first repository here on GitHub.  Writing the program "Hello World" is a bit too simple to pose any kind of challenge for a novice working with a new programming language.  One can write the following line of code to print "Hello World!"

`print("Hello World!")`

### Different Introductory Approach

The Python file in this repository explores the impoementation of what are called functions, written in the form:

```
def function(argument):
    return "the processed argument as output"
```
Functions take in an argument, process it as necessary for its use, then provides an output via the return statment.  The output can take the shape of a variable, which can point to an object.;
